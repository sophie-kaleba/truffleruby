slow:Kernel.at_exit runs after all other code
slow:Kernel.at_exit runs in reverse order of registration
slow:Kernel.at_exit allows calling exit inside a handler
slow:Kernel.at_exit gives access to the last raised exception - global variables $! and $@
slow:Kernel.at_exit both exceptions in a handler and in the main script are printed
slow:Kernel.at_exit decides the exit status if both at_exit and the main script raise SystemExit
slow:Kernel.at_exit runs all handlers even if some raise exceptions
slow:Kernel.at_exit runs handlers even if the main script fails to parse
slow:Kernel.at_exit calls the nested handler right after the outer one if a handler is nested into another handler
