/** Some Ruby methods need access to the caller special variables: see usages of {@link ReadCallerVariablesNode}. This
 * is used for methods which need to access the last regexp MatchData or the last IO line.
 *
 * <p>
 * This means that when making a method call, we might need to pass down its {@link SpecialVariableStorage} active when
 * the method call was made.
 *
 * <p>
 * Always passing the {@link SpecialVariableStorage} would be expensive, and the point of this base node is to only pass
 * it when we know for sure it has been requested by the callee. It is also possible to walk the stack to retrieve the
 * caller special variables - but this is even slower and causes a deoptimization in the callee every time we walk the
 * stack.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class works in tandem with {@link GetSpecialVariableStorage} for this purpose. At first, we don't send down the
 * {@link SpecialVariableStorage}. If the callee needs it, it will de-optimize and walk the stack to retrieve it (slow).
 * It will also call {@link #startSendingOwnVariables()}, so that the next time the method is called, the special
 * variables will be passed down and the method does not need further de-optimizations.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link ReadCallerVariablesNode} is used by child nodes that require access to this storage and this mechanism ensures
 * they receive an object that will not require CallTarget splitting to be accessed efficiently (i.e., part of the
 * calling convention and not having to find the value in the caller frame). */
